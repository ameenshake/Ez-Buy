# UBC-Project

Summary: Ez-Buy is the name of the project. It was done in my 3rd year at UBC for the Database course COSC 310. It is a shopping website, somewhat like eBay. It was built using JSP as a backend language and Microsoft SQL Server for database. It was my first experience using JSP as a backend here.

Features:

- Products List
- Shopping Cart with Add/Remove items feature
- Order summary at checkout
- Admin features such as updating inventory

For the rest of the features and more details, please refer to the Documentation (it's called Documentation.pdf).

Lessons learned:

- Java for a server side langauge is not pretty. Would have much rather used PHP in hindesight.
- You cannot expect to add features in the last minute, they almost always come out broken.
- Better to remove features than to dumb them down so much that they are there just for the sake of being there.
- Project management is harder than it looks. Should divide tasks early on and have strict dealines to finish said task, and then group should meet and merge the code.
- Should have used version control like Git. Saves the trouble of finding time and place to meetup and to merge code.
